# To Issues

Break a plan into independently-grabbable issues using vertical slices (tracer bullets), then publish them directly to GitHub Issues using the `mcp__github__` tools.

## Process

### 1. Gather context

Work from whatever is already in the conversation context. If the user passes an issue number or URL as an argument, fetch it with `mcp__github__git_get_issue` and read its full body before proceeding.

### 2. Explore the codebase (optional)

If you have not already explored the codebase, do so to understand the current state of the code. Issue titles and descriptions should use the project's domain glossary vocabulary and respect any ADRs in the area you're touching.

### 3. Draft vertical slices

Break the plan into **tracer bullet** issues. Each issue is a thin vertical slice that cuts through ALL integration layers end-to-end, NOT a horizontal slice of one layer.

Slices may be 'HITL' or 'AFK'. HITL slices require human interaction, such as an architectural decision or a design review. AFK slices can be implemented and merged without human interaction. Prefer AFK over HITL where possible.

<vertical-slice-rules>
- Each slice delivers a narrow but COMPLETE path through every layer (schema, API, UI, tests)
- A completed slice is demoable or verifiable on its own
- Prefer many thin slices over few thick ones
</vertical-slice-rules>

### 4. Quiz the user

Present the proposed breakdown as a numbered list. For each slice, show:

- **Title**: short descriptive name
- **Type**: HITL / AFK
- **Blocked by**: which other slices (if any) must complete first
- **User stories covered**: which user stories this addresses (if the source material has them)

Ask the user:

- Does the granularity feel right? (too coarse / too fine)
- Are the dependency relationships correct?
- Should any slices be merged or split further?
- Are the correct slices marked as HITL and AFK?

Iterate until the user approves the breakdown.

### 5. Publish the issues to GitHub

For each approved slice, create a GitHub issue using `mcp__github__git_create_issue`. Publish in **dependency order** (blockers first) so you have real issue numbers to reference in subsequent issues' bodies.

After all issues are created, wire up blockers with `mcp__github__git_link_issues` (link_type `"blocks"`) for each blocking relationship.

Use the issue body template below.

<issue-template>
## Parent

Issue #{number} — {title} (omit this section if the source was not an existing issue)

## What to build

A concise description of this vertical slice. Describe the end-to-end behavior, not layer-by-layer implementation.

Avoid specific file paths or code snippets — they go stale fast. Exception: if a prototype produced a snippet that encodes a decision more precisely than prose can (state machine, reducer, schema, type shape), inline it here and note it came from a prototype. Trim to the decision-rich parts only.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] Criterion 3

## Blocked by

- #{number} — {title}

Or "None — can start immediately" if no blockers.

</issue-template>

Do NOT close or modify any parent issue.
